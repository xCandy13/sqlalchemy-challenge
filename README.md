The climate_code.ipynb file contains the exploratory data analysis on the Hawaii climate sqlite database. It analyzes precipitation and temperature for the most recent 12 months,
for the most active station (USC00519281). It plots the precipitation data, describes the summary statistics for precipitation, and plots a histogram for the last year of
temperature data for the most active station.

The app.py file contains the Flask app to create an API for the Hawaii weather data.
